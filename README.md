## Main Concept

The main objective of this project was to create a web application that helps the user find gym exercises suited to the sports that they play.
I did this by creating a web application with three tiers.

### Front End

The front end of the project was developed in react and css. I had never used React before doing this project so it was a challenge at the start but I found the learning experience very beneficial in the end.

### Middle Tier

This tier involved two technologies which I also had not used before I did this project. The technologies being Heroku and mLab.

### Back end

The backend was also created by technologies which I had no previous experience of. These were Meteor and MongoDB.

## Features

The main features of the project are:

- The user is able to access the data from the Database on the application.
- The user is able to use the application on a cloud platform(Heroku) , however as of know some features that work locally do not work on the cloud version.
- The user is able to acces an About page which shows the user images of the exercises.
- The user is able to access this GitHub repository by clicking a link in the navigation bar.

## How to run

In order to run this project you must insure you have the following downloaded and installed:

- [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

Once these are all downloaded and installed correctly, simply navigate to the project folder and type the following command:

If everything is working correctly the application will appear on the localhost port 3000 in any browser.
